        Hi, my name is Berekt, a child of immigrant parents and a first generation college graduate. I have a passion for learning new things and building new skills, so I decided to learn more about coding.
        My goal is to become a Full-stack Junior Web Developer in the industry to gain more experience in the field.

Skills learned include: HTML 5, CCS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node.JS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, React.
