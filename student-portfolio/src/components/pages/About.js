      I am a recent graduate from the Ohio State University Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. I have spent the last several months working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and MongoDB, building everything from landing pages to APIs. I have a good understanding of both the client side and server side of the MERN stack tech because of the many projects I have done in the past.
